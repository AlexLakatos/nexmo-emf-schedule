    "description": "At EMF it's easy to see lots of cool things and think you \"that's awesome, but I couldn't possibly do that!\": this talk is about how to overcome that feeling and get started in a new domain.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, despite having not done any woodwork since high school, I decided to turn my hand at building electric guitars; with success enough that people are now commissioning me to make them for them. But to keep such an ambitious project manageable I had to create structure and tools around how I approached getting started and continuing to develop, and find ways to keep myself motivated in the days when it all goes wrong. This talk will review those methods so that you can try and apply them when you go to head off in a new direction yourself.",

Ultimately pushing them to better secure their services and thus protecting your privacy.\r\n\r\nAfter a short introduction you'll be surfing the web, finding names, addresses and urls of the UK government and adding them to the map. They will automatically be scanned for basic security. If all is well, they are shown green, otherwise orange or red. Expect a lot of red.\r\n\r\nThe results of our work will be sent to various press agencies in the UK. We hope they start asking questions about the sad state of security. This causes responsible organizations to wake up and adopt better practices, securing your data and privacy. We've seen this work in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nYou can expect: It's a lot of fun to see the amount of data grow, and more terribleness appear. Club Mate will be provided. The hunt is on!\r\n\r\nRequirements: This workshop is suitable for anyone with basic computer knowledge. Bring your own laptop / tablet / smartphone.\r\n\r\nAll data gathered is published publicly in easy to consume formats. The software running this is fully open source and available on gitlab. You can see an example of the Netherlands: https://faalkaart.nl.",

    "description": "Mexican food is becoming more and more popular in the UK and the range of restaurant options is expanding, particularly in large cities. However, it is almost certainly true that most people have never had the life-changing experience of tasting a truly authentic Mexican taco. Furthermore, I would imagine that most people would never think of attempting to make one at home, despite the fact that it is such a simple dish.\r\n\r\nAs a keen home-cook, who has lived in Mexico for the past 10 years, I am hoping to share this experience with people with a passion for trying new things.\r\n\r\nI will explain a little behind the theory of what makes a good taco, as well as introduce people to the core elements and constituents.\r\n\r\nThis will primarily be a sensory experience where people will be able to compare \"good\" vs. \"bad\" ingredients, and learn the basics of putting together a simple but delicious taco.",

In this workshop, all the participants will be able to be part of a giant micro:bit - teams will race against each other to run different programs, each attendee being a part of the machine. Thereâll be a small workshop at the beginning and the end so that we demystify the way computers work and understand what we're all doing.\r\n\r\nThis is a good companion to other programming workshops because it turns the concept on its head, with the participants running, not writing, programs.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just about *being* a CPU though, our aim is to optimise one. After running the first program, your team will be able to make changes to the CPU's arrangement and operation to optimise yourselves. If you've ever asked yourself \"what does it mean to be part of a 5-stage pipeline?\" or thought \"Can I try branch prediction today?\" then this is definitely the workshop for you.

    "description": "Almost everyone has traveled on a train, many commute on them every day, but surprisingly few know how signalling and control systems work.\r\n\r\nThe speaker will cover (at a very high level), train detection, train signalling across UK mainline and metro (tube) systems. As the UK mostly invented a lot of this stuff, it's applicable worldwide :)\r\n\r\nCome and be surprised how not-boring railways actually are (and how you could in theory implement a lot of it with arduinos and raspberry pis)!\r\n\r\nIncludes stories such as 'You could basically still repeat the great train robbery today, here's how' and 'Can you stop trains with only an ISM band radio?'. The speaker highly recommends none of this is applied in the real world. It would definitely not be a good idea. Please don't. But it's nice to know some technical details at least.\r\n\r\nThe speaker will assume no previous knowledge and the content is appropriate for all. It would mostly appeal to those who are interested in railways, transport and infrastructure. ",

    "description": "Contemporary software engineering is at a crucial juncture in the evolution as a discipline. Weâre professionalising and expanding our abilities, but in doing so weâre encountering dramatic new risks and venturing into new ethical territory. In this way, we share similarities with the expansion of traditional civil engineering during the industrial revolution. In this talk Iâll discuss what lessons can we learn from that industry, and how we can try to avoid making some of the same mistakes. Iâll also give a basic introduction to engineering ethics, discuss some examples of ethical problems from my own career, and explore how we can try to improve our ethical decision-making by incorporating ethical reasoning into the different stages of our work.",

    "description": "Spider silk is the strongest natural fibre known to man - stronger than steel, tougher than Kevlar, spider silks act as natural glues, cements, elastic capture webs and physical gills, all to enable spiders to survive and hunt on 6 out of 7 continents on Earth (the exception being icy Antarctica). \r\n\r\nI've spent the last 4 years researching spider silk at the University of Nottingham, learning how spiders have spent the last 386 million years adapting their silk to perform in a massive range of tasks. But now, scientists and industry professionals are looking into how we can adapt spider silk for our own purposes. Want a giant net that can catch falling Jumbos? We're on it. How about a biocompatible silk scaffold to help regrow that broken bone? We're on that too. \r\n\r\nThis is a 30 minute talk on the subject of spider silk aimed at those with an interest in, but no specialist knowledge of, science. There will be some pictures of spiders at the start but should otherwise be friendly for those who are interested but wary of things with eight legs. ",

This will also cover the trials and tribulations of making the game work and building the finished products.",

    "description": "Haikus are a form of short poetry originating from 17th Century Japan which are characterised by their use of syllable structure, juxtaposition and abstraction of ideas, and references to time and place. \r\n\r\nIn a modern world where communication often comes with character and time limits, we need to find ways to communicate complex ideas in short and more engaging ways.  Fun, easy, and they make everything sound better (and cleverer), Haikus are the answer!   \r\n\r\nThis workshop will give a brief history of Haikus, an overview of the basics, and some fun wordy activities before letting people unleash their vocabularic prowess on emf!  \r\n\r\nHaiku, timeless poetry \r\nJuxtaposing cherry blossom with  \r\nSyllabic framework \r\n\r\nModern nonsense  \r\nDistilled to bite-sized chunks \r\nEnrich souls \r\n\r\nA history, a review, \r\nVocabulary unleashed! \r\nChallenge accepted.

    "description": "While exploring her new home, a girl named Coraline discovers a secret door, behind which lies an alternate world that closely mirrors her own but, in many ways, is better. She rejoices in her discovery, until Other Mother and the rest of her parallel family try to keep her there forever. Coraline must use all her resources and bravery to make it back to her own family and life.\r\n\r\nThis beautifully animated piece takes Neil Gaimanâs source material and spins it into a fun and sometimes creepy fairy tale. Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) creates a series of stop-motion set pieces that equally bewilder and delight. A delicious alternative to saccharine-sweet Hollywood standards.\r\n\r\nMay be unsuitable for younger children.",

    "description": "At the beginning of 2017 I joined a volunteer Data Science community called Data for Democracy and became involved in a project focused on putting together a submission for a worldwide competition run by UNITE ideas (part of the United Nations) on behalf of the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC) in Geneva.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this challenge was to build a machine learning-driven tool that can automatically identify news and other written articles about âInternally Displaced Personsâ (people who have been forced from their homes by conflict or disaster). The platform also had to be able to extract key facts about the underlying events mentioned in the articles.\r\n\r\nI would like share the story of how our team, that had never met in person, put together a platform using almost 100% open source tools, and ultimately won the competition. We were subsequently invited to Geneva to help implement our platform, and we presented it to the broader non-profit community at an event at the International Red Cross museum.\r\n\r\nDuring my talk the areas I would like to address are:\r\n1. My experience of learning & getting involved in data science/programming/machine learning as a non-professional programmer\r\n2. What it was like to work on something constructive with a team from around the world that had never met each other\r\n3. The motivation behind needing this platform and how we put together a winning solution using open source tools",

Scientists think that Dark Matter is everywhere, streaming through you as you read this right now! Understanding the nature of Dark Matter is one of the most important scientific missions of our time. In this talk, I will present what evidence we have for the existence of Dark Matter, what we know, and how we go about finding out more about it.

    "description": "Following on from Rich Metson's 2016 talk 'Off Grid:  a game about circumvention tech and hacking,' this workshop is for anyone who wants to come and learn how to mod 'Off Grid' - a hacking game about surveillance and data privacy - and make their own levels and hacks!\r\n\r\nWe'll go over how to useLevelKit to build levels and how to mod or create your own Lua scripts to make your own righteous hacks, devices with abhorrent vulnerabilities, or data types that will alter space-time.\r\n\r\nThe idea being that players, modders and hackers (many of whom caught the hacking bug by messing around with games in the first place) will be able to use the game to tell new and interesting stories about hacking and surveillance, use the platform to build a dialogue around digital activism through play, create new hacking tools in the game, and who knows even drop a 0day or leak a massive political conspiracy or two for real ;P\r\n\r\nCome with a laptop and some unique hacking ideas and Rich will help you with the rest. No previous knowledge of Lua or game development required :D\r\n\r\n**If you want to get a jump start on things before the workshop, please download Unity, Steam, and have a read of 'Getting Started with Levelkit' on our wiki:. http://wiki.offgridthegame.com/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_the_LevelKit\r\n\r\nYou can watch the 2016 EMF talk here:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=suEXrMO6rQo#\r\n\r\nRead what Eurogamer has to say about Off Grid here:  https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-15-off-grid-is-about-the-principles-of-hacking\r\n",

    "description": "\"It's not natural!\"\r\n\r\nThis phrase is often used to try and justify bigotry and prejudice, especially against people who are LGBTQIA+, polyamorous, or women who don't fit traditional gender roles. But is it true? What do we mean by \"natural\"?\r\n\r\nAs a bisexual, polyamorous biologist and science presenter, Antonia Forster is keen to set the record straight (no pun intended). What behaviours do we see in nature? What's the difference between gender and sex? Can animals be gay, bi or trans? Are there organisms with more, or fewer, than two sexes? Prepare to see the animal kingdom as you've never seen it before...\r\n\r\nThis talk has previously been delivered to 2,000 people at TEDxBristol, and watched by over 14,000 online. Antonia has also spoken at Wilderness Festival, Kew Gardens, the Royal Society, Stanford University, Bristol Pride, the OvalHouse Theatre, BCFm Radio, and BBC Radio Bristol. Antonia has been nominated for the John Maddox prize for \"promoting scientific understanding in the face of hostility\"; and continues to campaign for under-represented groups, especially LGBTQIA+ and women in STEM and science media.",

It's a shame these are generally completely inaccurate, as behind them there are fascinating stories of intimacy and technology, computers and psychology. Throw in some science-fiction utopias and dystopias, loneliness and companionship, law and ethics, privacy and community and there is so much to be learned about our future with machines that could care for us and about us. The speaker has spent the past four years learning all about this topic: from 30,000 year old dildos to the world's first commercially-available sex robot (on sale now).

    "description": "Making is cool, but we talk and think a lot less about maintenance. Everything we make - software, hardware, communities - needs to be looked after, if it is useful. Sadly, maintaining, repairing and sustaining can be challenging in a fast-moving era, where this work can be seen as boring and low value, compared to the excitement around inventing or making new things. It is easy to forget that apps, data and connected systems need maintenance too, if they are to realise their potential and be useful or fun for more than a brief moment. \r\n\r\nAnd itâs not always easy. It can be hard to find good resourcing models for long-lasting products, or for looking after new forms of shared infrastructure (such as open source software libraries). Strong commons models, where groups share and steward resources (whether the knowledge in Wikipedia or open hardware designs) are scarce or difficult to replicate. \r\n\r\nWeâll talk about maintenance, good and bad examples of it, and what we are doing to recognise the work done in repair, custodianship, stewardship, tending and caring for things that matter.  \r\n",

    "description": "Governments and organisations the world over are releasing free LiDAR data - capturing the globe in 3D down to the metre. But how can you take this data and make into something tangible? And how can you do it at both the small scale of cities and the enormous scale of mountain ranges?\r\n\r\nWe'll look at three different methods of making 3D terrain models via both 3D printing and CNC machining - examining where the data comes from and LiDAR technology; the challenges of LiDAR data and how to shape it into 3D models; and how to take these highly detailed models and successfully print or machine them.",

    "description": "The drop spindle is a simple, handheld device, used to turn raw fibres into useable yarns and strings. In use since before recorded history, and still in use today, the drop spindle is portable, lightweight and versatile. It can be used to make a variety of yarns, from simple and practical, to bold and creative.\r\n\r\nYou'll learn the basics of how to turn soft, non-scratchy, merino wool fibre into a useable yarn. How to tweak your spinning to make yarns suitable for different purpose, and how to finish your yarns ready for use. We'll also cover the different kinds of plant and animal fibres, and their properties in spinning. There will be an oppourtunity to see a variety of different fibres, but wool will be the only fibre availiable to work with, as it is by far the simplest for beginners.\r\n\r\nThe kit is yours to take home, and includes 100g of wool fibre. Enough to make a full sized ball of yarn.",

What do past ideas about zombies tell us about zombies now? And how do video game zombies reflect current ideas about ethics?

    "description": "Light is managed using lenses, objectives, telescopes. In theatre or TV, it is common to see spotlights following characters and laser lights creating special effects. Similar control on sound is difficult: you need expensive sets of speakers, like the ones in musical festivals, in ultrasound scanners, and in haptic devices.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will introduce another way: using 3D-printed materials, specially-engineered to manipulate sound. Using tractor beams, levitation pods (for polystyrene beads) and other demos, I will guide the audience towards a (not-so-far) future where what we see in science fiction movies like Iron Man or Minority Report is real. A world where two people will be able to listen at two different programs from the same radio or to receive personalised sound messages without headphones. A world where music at outdoor festivals and in beer gardens will be managed while preserving airflow. A world where sound control is a DIY task.",

As of Aug 2018 Matrix has around 5.5M reachable users and over 8000 server instances, ranging from individual personal servers through to massive deployments for governments and telcos - and a huge community of open source contributors building alternative clients, bots,  bridges, servers etc.\r\n\r\nToday Matrix is in late beta, but as of the end of 2017 the protocol is feature frozen as we converge on a 1.0 release later in 2018.  In this talk we'll give an overview of the Matrix protocol, the ecosystem, the road to 1.0 and show off all the latest clients and capabilities - including some of the more exciting non-IM usages, such as VR communication!",

    "description": "Failure is a great teacher, but we do not often talk openly about failure in a public setting. As a scientist (and failure enthusiast), I am trying to encourage my community to talk more about failure, which is difficult since the path to success is to publish about successes and to hide failures. Let's do more to talk about failure as a Maker community. Let's be honest about the dead-ends and dumb mistakes that got us to that early prototype. Rather than ridiculing 'fails', let's instead celebrate them, since they're what we learn from and allows us to become better than we are.\r\n\r\nInstead of teaching people that failure is bad, let's teach them how to be resilient to failure - give them a safe space to fail in, and provide them the encouragement to keep working towards success. \r\n\r\nAs a social experiment, I will setup a slackline at EMF Camp and invite you to come and try to slackline for the first time and *livestream you failure* with the tag #EMFailure.

    "description": "Often we use graphs and charts ('visualizations') to display information in a way which makes understanding the data they show seem intuitive. They are used by well dressed individuals to show their projected quarterly earnings, by primary school teachers introducing exciting new ideas to wide eyed children, and by news organisations trying to explain that it's definitely ok to drink that 5th cup of coffee. But all's not fair in charts and graphs, intentionally or not they are not always faithful to the data. How can you spot a misleading chart, and what happens when what they don't reflect the truth? \r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll tour the visualization jungles, looking at some of the scariest, most dangerous, and weirdest visualizations out there. You'll learn some of the tricks used to change what a visualization shows and see examples of some previous weird and wonderful visualizations. By the end of our tour you'll know what to watch out for in your future visualization adventures, and how to make you own visualizations a little less intimidating or misleading to fellow adventurers.",

Most thoughtful people, reflecting on the present trajectory of history, get the uncomfortable feeling that we are all being driven toward economic, political and ecological disaster, and that international banking has something to do with it.\r\n\r\nThis has made banking the focus of numerous conspiracy theories, most of which contain useful and verifiable information, but all of which fail in one key respect: they all subordinate the banking system to the agency of secretive groups of people who supposedly control the whole system across generations.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy scenario, bad as it is, holds out the comforting thought that if we could just identify and take out the shadowy figures who are really in control, then everything could be put right. But what if the truth is even more terrible? What if the system has its own internal logic, like a virus or an algorithm, which needs no human hand to guide it?\r\n\r\nThis talk goes back to the basic principles, and the medieval Italian and English origins, of the banking system to explore its algorithmic properties. I will argue that credit systems are not only a powerful tool in the hands of human and organizations like governments and corporations, but also that they have revolutionary effects on the priorities and and agendas of those organizations. That the tool, in other words - like Elric of Melnibone's 'Stormbringer' or Faust's 'Mephistopheles' - guides the hand that seek to wield it.",

    "description": "How do people with disabilities use the internet? Accessibility and inclusive design have gained popularity recently, but a lot of web developers are still unaware of what they can do to make their sites and apps work for everyone. Even with a lot of goodwill, practical knowledge is needed: it can be overwhelming to try to use a screen reader, use the internet without a mouse, get notifications with no audio or empathise with reading and cognitive impairments. Things like ARIA and tab order logic can also be intimidating and may lead developers to make experiences worse when they think they are improving it.\r\n \r\nThis workshop will be part-talk, part-practical, to demystify accessibility: why it matters, what are the things to consider, how to test and find issues, and most importantly what you can do to fix them. Participants will have hands-on exercises of using a screen reader on their own devices, navigating using just a keyboard, and identify what's a good and a terrible experience. We will work on hands-on exercises with HTML and JavaScript to fix custom components, understand the logic, and for more experienced developers we will cover ARIA components and building accessible custom elements like accordions and tab panels.",

    "description": "News and media outlets on the web are silos of information designed to be taken at face value and are resistant to aggregation and side-by-side analysis because - after all - they're really just vehicles to sell ads.\r\n\r\nWhere aggregation is available to the average user (usually on social media), news feeds are customized on behalf of the user with algorithms they can't understand or control.\r\n\r\nTo try and solve this problem for myself, I attempted to aggregate web content via RSS feeds, but found most article bodies are just click-through links and no actual content.\r\n\r\nThat's why I wrote a RSS/Atom reconstitutor, web scraper and search indexer - to be able to get feeds of news, blogs and reports I could read and analyze without the filter bubble.\r\n\r\nBut this talk is only a *bit* about that - it's the technical backbone around which we will explore surveillance, news as data, the ethics of advertising, and subverting some hilariously paper thin content protections.\r\n\r\nIn a talk for all levels of technical ability, I'd like to share the things I learned along the way and encourage everyone to question how they can use their own skills to take back control of information on the web and overcome the status quo.",

    "description": "The Large Hadron Collider is the latest step in the continuing endeavour of particle physicists to understand our universe. Colliding hydrogen nuclei 40 million times every second the LHC is a powerful microscope looking into the world of the microcosm.  Experiments like ATLAS are detecting the products of these collisions. The large amount of data generated by these detectors are analysed by an international collaboration of physicists and have led already to important insights.\r\nWhere are we going next after the Nobel Prize winning discovery of the Higgs Boson?\r\nI will talk about current particle physics research, the ongoing hunt for Dark Matter and some of the technical challenges phased by experiments operating at this amazing machine.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "When I learned the news that I had somewhat accidentally become the owner of a Decommissioned, 12 Storey High, Late Soviet Era, Water Tower in Latvia: naturally my first question was 'Could I use it to prop up a Buran?' (The USSR's equivalent of the US Space Shuttle)...  and If I'd have asked that question to Woking District council, then I'm guessing the answer would be a list of regulations that would contravene - but in Latvia, the answer was 'Yes, it is your tower so you can do what you like with it...'\r\n\r\nAnd so I had a challenge to work out what could and should be done with the tower and in very British tradition a list of 101 Hacks for a Water Tower was started, which was very rapidly joined by a sister list of 101 Ways to Kill Yourself on Water Tower.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I share some of the journey of exploration into the wonderful world of Water Towers, Soviet Engineering, the Baltics, and a bit of family history. This takes us from the British Water Tower Appreciation Society to Siberia and the SS, whilst taking part in a documentary, getting involved in an Olympic bid, making music, setting up an amateur radio station, breaking records (and a drone) on the tower on the way and much more.\r\n\r\nThe talk is generally light hearted, with a balance of education and amusement.

A gyro was Â£160 back then, a 3 axis IMU is now about Â£5, how things have changed.\r\n\r\nSince then I have built one and two wheeled boards, 2 wheeled wheelchair prototype and many others, documented on YT and Instructables, long before such gadgets came out from China, culminating in a 3000W hubmotor 1 wheeled motorcycle which I plan to bring to the camp and demonstrate.

What should I use?\r\n-\tSoldering best practices and handy tips i.e. how to apply heat and solder to a joint.\r\n-\tVariations in components and the distinctions between polarised and unpolarised parts.\r\n\r\nDuring the workshop I would like to have attendees assemble one easy kit and one intermediate kit. The easy kit is a classic noisemaker/synth circuit, the mini APC (Atari Punk Console) including a small speaker. \r\nThe intermediate kit, which most beginners can handle after soldering the mini APC is a simple 8 step sequencer. The sequencer is able to sequence the mini APC by way of control voltages and gate signals, if all goes well the tent would be filled with people making 8 step musical loops.",

    "description": "ArduTouch makes way cool sound, music, and noise!  It is an open hardware, Arduino-compatible musical instrument with a touch keyboard, amp, and speaker.  It is easy to build -- designed for total beginners to learn to solder together.  It provides a very low cost, yet powerful, method for making music/sound/noise, and a fun way to learn Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for generating music/sound/noise. This talk will show beginners how the ArduTouch music synthesizer kit makes use of DSP to create its large diversity of music/sound/noise. Mitch will also explain how the touch keyboard works, as well as the cheap amplifier/speaker built into the board. The ArduTouch Arduino library works on any Arduino board and Mitch will demonstrate how to make use of this library to create your own unique synthesizers -- both by hacking some of the many examples it comes with, and by making use of its high-level functions. This talk will also include a demo of some of the music the ArduTouch can make, as well as some wonderful nasty noise!\r\n\r\nA workshop for soldering together ArduTouch music synthesizer kits will be held before the talk on Sunday at 1pm at the Hardware Hacking Area (Camp: G).",

    "description": "As a member of the team who brought WaveNet into production, I would like to give an insight into the technical challenges and the technology which powers Google's voice, and how this type of algorithms could be used to solve other interesting problems.\r\n\r\nWaveNet is a machine learning algorithm developed at (Google) DeepMind which was the first to obtain human-like quality of voice directly modeling waveforms. You can read more about it here: \r\n\r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/ \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet\r\n\r\nSince the original paper was published, there has been several developments to substantially speed up audio generation (several order of magnitude) in order to put it into production, and it is now powering Google's assistant voice in several languages. See also: \r\n\r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/ \r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/high-fidelity-speech-synthesis-wavenet/ \r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435\r\n\r\nNote that the technology is not limited to audio and can pretty much work with any signal, but this is so new that we're just scratching the surface of the potential applications.\r\n\r\nIn my talk I will be talking about the basic tech, what it took to get it into production and the more recent developments. I would also like to give a few suggestions and hints on how to reproduce these results: the latest version (WaveRNN) is rather simple to implement and yet very powerful.",

Women, BME (Black and minority ethnic) people, people with disabilities, older people, and people on low incomes are often under-represented in makerspaces. In the first part of this workshop Iâll share some of the ways that makerspaces are managing to include people from these groups. Then I'd love to hear your stories about any successes and challenges you've experienced with building inclusive and diverse makerspace communities. Even if you don't have any success stories, if your makerspace hasn't been able to spend much time on engagement, or if you're not even involved in makerspaces but are curious about technology engagement issues, you're welcome to come along!\r\n\r\nAfter EMF Iâll turn the information crowdsourced during the workshop into a zine so that other makerspaces can benefit from this advice :)",

    "description": "During the build up to the Apollo space programme, mathematically gifted women, typically African-American, worked in high-pressure âpoolsâ churning out answers to NASAâs seemingly impossible questions. They were known as âcomputersâ.\r\n\r\nThree women challenged the status quo, demanding recognition, authority and respect.

    "description": "High Street clothing brands are developing digital machines to replace mass production with mass customisation. They aim to give customers more choice, but still as consumers rather than makers. We will explore how makerspaces could adapt these tools for DIY clothes making and show some of the tools that are accessible now.\r\n\r\nUsing new technologies, you no longer need to be a specialist to design clothes and shoes that fit perfectly. We will bring examples, including 3D printed sandals, a shoe last and insole, laser cut fabric and 3D printed accessories.\r\n\r\nWe will also highlight textile related developments in makerspaces including the raspberry pi 3D body scanner scanner we helped design at BuildBrighton, and hope to inspire more people to get involved in shaping new DIY technology.\r\n\r\n",

However, beginners are often prevented from getting started with modular synths by their costs and apparent complexity. This workshop will be a hands-on introduction to making interesting sounds from modular synthesizers for complete beginners. We will use the open source simulated modular synthesizer \"VCV Rack\" to allow the participants to get the feel of working with a real modular synthesizer on their computer.",

It's often used to solve problems such as spam email detection, natural language translation, to find images matching certain search criteria, or to make music recommendations. This talk will turn the problem around and examine the extent to which neural networks can emulate human creativity. We'll start by thinking about what it means for an algorithmic system to be creative. Then through examples we'll look at how techniques in machine learning can be used to compose original music and generate art. During the talk, we'll see how changing the algorithms and modifying the inputs to the neural networks affect the music and art created. We'll conclude by discussing future directions in the field of computational creativity, and thinking about whether computers will ever be able to match human levels of performance in this area.",

Why bother updating the old code, or having one at all? What's the code asking me to do, and why? How can I practically use the code? How did you decide whether something is good or bad, or whether something should be included in the code? What if my boss thinks codes of ethics are for losers? What if I work in the military/security/etc. domain? How is this code different from all the other codes out there?

    "description": "The impact of major space weather events are currently being discussed at the highest level of governments and is an active area of research. The potential damage of a solar superstorm to our national economy, communications network and electricity grid is a real threat and must be taken seriously. Such storms can cause the loss of GPS (with many more consequences than just not being able to find the way to EMF Camp), alter the orbits of satellites and could cripple the electricity grids around the world. \r\n\r\nCome along to join Dr. Sean Elvidge from the University of Birmingham to explore the causes of space weather, the potential repercussions (and likelihood) of a superstorm and an explanation of the work that is currently being undertaken to understand and mitigate these risks.",

    "description": "In 1976, in an amusement park in Southern California, the crew of The Six Million Dollar Man were setting up a scene in a fun house.  They moved a waxwork dummy, accidentally broke off its arm, and discovered that rather than being made of wax, it was made of a real dead guy.\r\n\r\nWith a bit of investigation, the coroner discovered it was Elmer McCurdy, a failed bank robber who died in 1911.  Between his death and his discovery, he visited sideshows, hung out at Niagra Falls, rode on rollerskates, became a drug addict, and inspired the look of Skeletor from the He-Man cartoons and toys.\r\n\r\nWe'll get into Elmer's actual life, his adventures after his death, and where he's residing now.

    "description": "A Forest School inspired activity. This would appeal to all ages of children as the wands can be as simple or complex as each individual sees fit.  Initially I would set the scene with some tree folklore or story relating to willow and dogwood.  Then, I would show how to bend the willow or dogwood into a wand shape and secure it.  The youngest children could then decorate their wand with natural resources, (or I could provide some coloured string, ribbon, feathers etc).  The older children could use basic woodcrafting tools such as potato peelers to strip the wands and whiltting knives to add carving notches for decoration, in addition.   I would imagine the younger children finishing earlier, but for older children this taking about an hour.  I would prefer all children to be accompanied by an adult, especially if they are hoping to use the tools.  I am a teacher, so CRB checked and Level 3 Qualified Forest School Leader.",

They can be used as a way of expressing feelings, explore simple emotions and tell points of view.\r\n\r\nBitsy is a tiny tool made especially for creating games which are based on exploration and narrative. Its pixel art minimalistic visual style makes it perfect to just sit down and make a game in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThe output is a simple HTML file, so the game is not only playable almost everywhere, itâs also really easy to distribute and opens chances of hacking and tinkering.\r\n\r\nWe will learn how to create games with Bitsy, both from a technical point of view and from a narrative point of view. We will explore space layout, dialogues, rhythm.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the workshop youâll be able to create small narrative experience to enjoy with your friends, to deliver powerful messages and to dip your toe in the crazy world of game making. So, come on over with your laptop. Itâs going to be great fun!",

    "description": "As a person that practices both art & computer science, I have found there can be an interaction between the two, where ideas and patterns from one discipline can be transferred in a new form into the other.\r\n\r\nI have created a workshop that introduces ideas about what is important in drawing and what are the steps to creating a picture using terminology familiar to people in tech.The workshop consists of some theoretical parts and engaging hands-on exercises, aided by a custom tool. Exercises include drawing cylinders from several angles while being aware of the 3d shape of the object, using a custom grid to copy a sketch and doing several iterations of thumbnails to explore an idea for a drawing. All the while, feedback and suggestions are offered to the participants.\r\n\r\nThe end outcome is that participants gain more confidence in their drawing abilities, go deeper into drawing even simple forms and understand that the underlying process for drawing is not a magical fuzzy path, but consists of many sequential and âdeterministicâ steps.",

You learn that this magic box can be programmed to do all sorts of amazing things, but are never really given the details as to how it does it. I wanted to know more, and after some research I started making logic gates with the one bit of electronics I knew how to use: Electric relays. I scrounged parts from cars, microwaves, scrap change machines, etc and put them together into increasingly complex contraptions. Two years later, I had TIM 8: a fully programmable 8 bit relay computer. This is the story of how TIM 8 came about, what I learnt along the way, and how relay computers are a fantastic way to demonstrate how a computer really works.\r\n\r\nFor the talk I would bring a presentation and TIM 8 (the size of a small suitcase).",

    "description": "Geiger counters are interesting and surprisingly useful devices, and you can build one for less than the price of a video game. They can monitor background radiation levels, check household items such as smoke alarms and gas mantles, and provide information about medical treatments. I designed and built my own unit having been diagnosed with cancer in 2017, and it has provided some fascinating insights.\r\n\r\nThis talk describes the design and construction of a simple Geiger counter with an OLED display and a recording facility, and illustrates some of the science behind medical procedures involving radiation, such as PET scans (Positron Emission Tomography) and radiotherapy.",

    "description": "Hannah Fry will explain the inner workings of algorithms: their power, their limitations, and whether they really are an improvement on the humans they replace. With algorithms making important decisions in healthcare, transport, finance, security, even what we watch, how much should we rely on them? What kind of future do we want?\r\n\r\nYou are accused of a crime. Who would you rather determine your fate â a human or an algorithm? An algorithm is more consistent and less prone to error of judgement. Yet a human can look you in the eye before passing sentence.\r\n\r\nYou need a liver transplant to save your life. Who would you want in charge of organ allocation? An algorithm can match organ donors with patients, potentially saving many more lives. But it may send you to the back of the queue.\r\n\r\nYouâre buying a (driverless) car. One vehicle is programmed to save as many lives as possible in a collision. Another promises to prioritize the lives of its passengers. Which do you choose?",

    "description": "Information security is a big deal nowadays as more and more people start to take their privacy online very seriously. But what's the point of protecting yourself if the web services you use are vulnerable to big scary hackers?\r\n\r\nIf you want to catch a glimpse of penetration testing, come along and learn about concepts such as discovering vulnerabilities, running through them, exploiting and patching them.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be based around a University coursework project, where an older version of web forum software \"phpBB\" is examined, exploited and patched. The technologies that phpBB was built on were quite simple, so the main focus of the talk will be the process of penetration testing.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics covered will include sanitising user input, as well as enforcing file and variable scopes. You will familiarise yourself with concepts such as never trusting user input and get to see exploits such as cross-site scripting and remote code execution.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will wrap up by patching out these vulnerabilities and hopefully learn a thing or two about building more secure software.",

    "description": "VIEON is the electronic musical project of Matt Wild, based in Coventry, UK. Expanding to a live three-piece including sound engineer Stephen Dorphin and VJ Adrian Brian Thompson, their sound is inspired heavily by the 70s and 80s European art electronica pioneers (Jarre, Moroder, Kraftwerk), combined with the more recent influences of contemporary synthpop artists (Royksopp, Justice) as well as infusing aspects of dance, post-rock and ambient music.\r\n\r\nThe VIEON live show is a complete audio-visual event, using not only banks of synthesizers and samplers but also unusual visual instrumentation including vocoder, keytar, theremin and live projected technology and science-fiction inspired visuals including live webcam feeds of what's happening onstage.\r\n\r\nVIEON have raised their profile dramatically throughout 2015-17 with a series of engaging live audio-visual shows famed for their ambitious scope across the UK and beyond, playing their first overseas gig to a rapturous reception in Copenhagen in September 2017.",

    "description": "There are a number of emoji that, when used in digital communications, don't always refer to their original meaning. The peach emoji, for example, has been found through research conducted by emojipedia to refer most often not to the fruit, but to buttocks. Other fruit and vegetables emoji have suffered a similar fate.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explore the ways that emoji are frequently misunderstood or misused - referring to some of the leading research conducted by academics in the area. I will conclude with peer reviewed research that I have conducted looking at the ways we assign new meaning to emoji when communicating with a single other person. Why do we do this and how do we choose the emoji we use. Why is it that despite there being a heart emoji available, some of us choose to use ð to say \"I love you\"?\r\n\r\nThe set is presented in a stand up comedy-style and despite discussing academic research is very accessible to any range of audience. Although parental guidance may be advised.",

There are many resources out there, and many things to try. It does take a long time to produce a piece, so it's not a cheap thing to purchase, but it should be cheap and easy to practice.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours, I will teach how to make rings from wire, explain aspect ratios for rings, and some basic sheet weaves (E4 in 1, J12 in 2). We will then move on to some chains using the basics of these weaves (Box chain, Byzantine Chain, Helm Chain).\r\n\r\nIf there is time and/or interest after this, I'd welcome some time looking at specific projects and helping to start those projects off.

But podcasting has not only survived three global hype cycles it's also one of the most resilient and unique media forms on the Internet. So far, Podcasting has successfully resisted being sucked up by a single YouTube-style platform that looks helpful in the beginning but would set the rules of its community in the future.\r\n\r\nInstead Podcasting is very much alive and has proven to be able to create new and serve to existing communities, communicate effectively to its audience and establish a following other media types haven't seen yet. Podcasts are sexy and you really want to know why.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain in detail why podcasts matter, what makes podcasts magical when combined with community, why almost everybody should consider starting a podcast, which infrastructure on the net is actually useful, what kind of hardware is actually needed and what open source and free-ish tools exist to publish high quality audio content on the web today.",

    "description": "Most people know that you can have your ashes launched into space, or made into a diamond once youâve been cremated, but being cremated is far from your only option. From alkaline hydrolysis to freeze-drying, there are many (legal) ways to dispose of a body. Whether you want to nourish fungi, roses, a coral reef or the minds of trainee doctors, your remains could make the world a better place. Why be scattered, when you can leave behind something way more interesting?\r\n\r\nThis session will look at what actually happens in a crematorium and a burial (both traditional and green) as well as some of the more unusual alternatives that are now available to dispose of a body and the controversies that surround them.\r\n\r\nPlease note: if you just canât live with your spouse any more, or you have a life-long vendetta against someone, this session wonât help you get that sorted out. Seek counselling. Buy a pet. Get out more. But donât kill them.\r\n",

    "description": "I've designed a series of PCB modules that can be wired in series to form wearable circuits: necklaces, bracelets, or even epaulets and other accessories.\r\nEach small PCB has solderable pads for large SMD or through-hole components â including LEDs, resistors, coin battery holders, and so forth.\r\nEach holds one component, except for a few which are decorative (such as LED diffusers), and I plan to expand with more.\r\nThe PCBs also include strain-relief features; they are connected with wires to form \"ropes\" of circuitry, supported by a braided hemp sheath.\r\n\r\nThe project expands on a current trend in approachable tech: enabling people to build circuits with crafts such as stickers (Chibitronics), painting (Bare Conductive), and Lego (Crazy Circuits / Leguino). I want to do the same with jewelry-making.\r\n\r\nI'll have some prototypes and demos, and I'd like to talk about how to use them, how they help me visualize the flow of electricity, and how to contribute. I'll also bring a few kits to give out! ",

Join the Vagina Museum as they talk about why we need one, their experiences researching vaginas, vulvas and all parts related, what would go in a museum about the gynaecological anatomy and the wonderful and strange reactions encountered whilst making the world's first physical vagina museum.\r\n\r\nThe museum will have four permanent galleries: science, culture, society and history. The science section will cover topics from the anatomy to health, menstruation to menopause, contraception to consent, sexuality to gender identity. The culture collection will showcase the anatomy in the arts and their contribution to the discourse about our genitals, for example The Great Wall of Vagina or The Handmaidâs Tale. The society gallery will explore genitalsâ place in society, e.g. religious rites surrounding menstruation, the practises of FGM, of which over 200 million people are living today suffering from, sexual violence and how these cases are dealt with in court. The history gallery will contain objects relating to the history of gynaecological medicine, contraception, menstrual products and sex work.",

    "description": "Youâve heard of smart phones, smart meters, smart watchesâ¦ even smart fridges. Well now itâs the turn of smart materials.\r\n\r\nThis is a show about the future of stuff. Within our lifetimes, solid objects will react, sense, change and move according to their surroundings. This wonât be a result of fancy robotics or cunning electronics, but rather the fundamental properties of the materials themselves. Inspired by Leonardo da Vinciâs flying machine, drawn over 500 year ago, smart materials will make our aeroplanes of the future adapting, sensing and morphing, so that they fly like birds or bats. In years to come, we will be living in self-regulating houses, riding self-fixing bicycles, and driving on self-illuminating roads, all thanks to smart materials. These are metals, plastics, fabrics and fluids that react to the outside world without any human involvement, and they promise to change the way we live our lives forever.\r\n\r\nIn this one hour show, an award-winning materials scientist and engineer will be your guide on the smart material safari. There will be demonstrations of the smart materials that exist today, and exploration on how they will make the material world around us smarter tomorrow. Expect to see matter doing things youâve never seen it do before!\r\n",

    "description": "HiTag2 is an RFID technology operating at 125KHz. It is distinguished from many others in the same field by its use of 2-way communications for authentication and its use of encryption to protect the data transmissions - the majority of RFID technologies at 125KHz feature no authentication or encryption at all. As a result it has been widely used to provide secure building access and has also been used as the technology that implements car immobilisers.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, academic researchers Roel Verdult, Flavio D. Garcia and Josep Balasch published the seminal paper, âGone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2â that presented three attacks on the encryption system used in HiTag2. They implemented their attacks on the Proxmark 3 device (an RFID research and hacking tool) and gave several high-profile demonstrations, but didnât release any of their code or tools. Since then, the forums supporting Proxmark 3 and RFIDler (another RFID hacking tool) have received many requests for implementations of these attacks, but until recently none had been forthcoming. Garcia et al went on to produce a fast correlation attack in the 2016 paper, âLock It and Still Lose Itâ.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explain how HiTag2 RFID works in detail, including the PRNG and the authentication and encryption protocols, and will present my own implementations of the attacks, written for RFIDler and supported by desktop computers. The first attack uses a nonce replay to misuse the integrity protection of the comms in order to allow access to the readable RFID tag pages without needing to know the key. The second, third and fourth attacks use time/memory trade-off brute force, cryptanalytic attacks and a fast correlation attack to recover the key, such that the contents of the read-protected pages can also be accessed. The attacks are weaponised and permit cloning of tags, which I will demonstrate.",

    "description": "A talk which will appeal to anyone who has an interest in making their own electronic music instruments and noise makers. Starting simply, with creating your own contact mics and spring reverbs, progressing all the way to creating your own midi controllers and fully programmable digital audio effects. The concept is to show you how easy it is to get started (I had no formal electronics background, and just learnt from experimenting) and inspire you to get started making NOISE.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover my personal journey through DIY instrument building, which I embarked on initially to build a simple item I needed for my live performance, and rapidly spiralled out of control!\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/sdTysy3dD84\r\nhttps://youtu.be/gib-URplJxI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xWpq3soblYY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/5j84GfI8yQM\r\n\r\nAbout the artist:\r\nCutlasses is the solo project of musician and DIY electronic instrument maker, Scott Pitkethly.  \r\n\r\nHe has given a number of of talks on the subject of DIY instrument building, as well as talks on other programming related subjects.  His electronic instruments won the Music Hackspace DIY Instrument award, and have featured on sites such as Hackaday and Create Digital Music. The homemade instruments combine both analogue and digital electronics to manipulate and deconstruct audio.\r\n",

    "description": "How can classical ballet be used a medium for computer science theory, digital ethics and visualisation biometric data including EEG? What will the future hold for the human body and communication when we boldly go into space? What ethical consideration must we take to ensure that it is the many who control their personal data?\r\n\r\nWeâve been making educational, technologically exciting ballets and performance workshops for five years now. As artists we want to do collaborative learning with our audiences, to help them express their own ideas within a collaborative artistic technological framework. It is not just a performance to sit down and watch. Art and performance can break down the traditional barriers to audiences that consider themselves non-technical. We like to release as much of our performance and learning materials as possible as open source.\r\n\r\nOur project is long-running, and has tackled subjects from chronic pain to sorting algorithms. Now we are looking to space, brain hacking, and unashamed futurism. How can we begin to live in the future while increasing accessibility and inclusivity? What are the ethical concerns surrounding things that might seem abstract at first glance - like brainwave data?\r\n\r\nClassical ballet might sound like a strange way to learn about technology, ethics and medicine, but we hope to change the way you think about education/learning. Combining the algorithmic nature of classical ballet with futuristic thinking, breaking down artificial cultural barriers and fostering personal creative ownership for all. \r\n\r\nMay contain duct tape.",

    "description": "If you love Science Fiction, Technology, Model Making, 3D Printing and Design, then this is the perfect workshop for you, and even if you are new to any of these things, its still definitely worth giving it a go!  \r\n\r\nWe will be exploring how Science Fiction can teach us a few things about the creation of new technologies. We will be focusing on the future of 3D Printing, but the process I will guide you through can be applied to anything and everything. This will provide a great opportunity to flex your creative muscles and question how we want to use technology in the future. We will be using a combination of sketching, drawing, sketch modelling, illustrating, doodlingâ¦pretty much anything you want to create your 3D Printers of the future.  \r\n\r\nSome materials will be provided for you to rip, tear, cut, stick and glue, but do bring along any materials you think could be useful.",

(blame Ukrainian post)\nSorry!\n\n\n\n\nRadioactivity is as fascinating as it is frightening because humans cannot sense it, and it can be dangerous in high doses. In this workshop, Yannick Verbelen from the University of Bristol introduces radioactivity and ionizing radiation detection principles on a level suitable for all ages. After a brief introduction, participants build their own radiation detector based on a Soviet era SBM-20 Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube, and test it by measuring various radioactive materials. Basic soldering skills and understanding of electronics are recommended but not necessary. Following this workshop does not guarantee mutations, superpowers, or survival.

My partner and I built some custom wheelchair accessories together and modified existing products for our own use, and would like to teach others to do the same. We think that people with additional requirements should have the same access to technology as everyone else and people in wheelchairs and users of accessibility equipment should be seen and be seen with. We want accessible designs to be modern, funky and useful.\n\nThe accessible pixel modules are programmable coloured LED strips used as indicators, illumination, and decoration of a wheelchair, accessibility accessory, backpack or anything you might think of. powered with a 5 volt powerbank and connected to a convenient control panel. They are designed to adapt to a userâs needs.\n\nThis is a workshop for other wheelchair users and their friends where they have the opportunity to make their own accessible pixel modules and also design and build their own accessories. We will bring kits for people to purchase and build their first accessible pixel module and provide a list of parts should they wish to build more on their own. We will also have parts and tools available for prototyping other accessories. We will show the basics of writing code for Arduino and how to create a finished product adapted to your needs. We will also cover basic soldering techniques and open a discussion around what other people with additional requirements need and how they can solve their own problems by creating technology.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost     Â£20 per kit (10 Spaces Available)\nSuitable age range     Any, but with parents if under 13\nAttendees should bring     Laptop (preferable)",

Full tuition is provided and takes around 2 to 3 hours however there isnât really a timescale you just need to be finished by 2pm to allow time to cast your design.\n\nAll the materials are provided for you to sketch your design onto the stone or trace your pattern. Once youâve carved your design, you can do a test impression by using salt dough. Once you are happy with it weâll cast it in Pewter. Itâs really easy to do and if you would prefer to take you stone away and carve it at your leisure, then pop back for advice or when you are ready to cast it.\n\nSessions start at 10am and 11am and costs Â£25 to cover materials\n\nhttps://pewtercasting.wordpress.com/2018/08/24/the-journey-begins/\n\nFollow #EMFyaf for updates",

    "description": "Join us at Yorkshire and friends village for a traditional pewter casting workshop by carving your design in soft stone. Full tuition is provided and takes around 2 to 3 hours however there isnât really a timescale you just need to be finished by 4pm to allow time to cast your design.\n\nAll the materials are provided for you to sketch your design onto the stone or trace your pattern. Once youâve carved your design, you can do a test impression by using salt dough. Once you are happy with it weâll cast it in Pewter. Itâs really easy to do and if you would prefer to take you stone away and carve it at your leisure, then pop back for advice or when you are ready to cast it.\n\nEach session begins on the hour and costs Â£25 to cover material costs.\n\nhttps://pewtercasting.wordpress.com/2018/08/24/the-journey-begins/\n\nFollow #EMFyaf for updates",

Think of it as a cross between a treasure hunt and an escape room.\n\n\nWhere?\n======\nWe are based in a shipping container in the Null Sector area of the campsite. \n\n\nWhen?\n=====\nYou can start at any time. We'll be running from Friday 8pm until Sunday 3pm. The hunt will take 1 - 3 hours if done all at once, but can be completed at your leisure.\n\n\nSurely there's some kind of story?\n===========================\nThe Professor is dead, her laboratory has been ransacked, her PhD students are accusing each other of murder, and something is watching from the other side of the Dreamcatcher...\n\nProfessor Alia Gold had a dream: to build the world's first truly imaginative machine. But for reasons unknown, just before her death, she split her research into ten fragments and hid them all around the EMF campsite.\n\nYour quest: to retrieve all ten shards - and solve the mystery of her death... but watch out. Nothing is as it seems, and your choices may affect the very course of human history. \n\n===========================\n\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttps://dreamcatcherpuzzle.xyz \n\n\nContact us at:\n\ndreamcatcher.puzzle@gmail.com\nor talk to us -- we're in the tent with the flamingo on top, near the quiet area (a bit east of our location on the map.)",

    "description": "Learn what it's like to see the world without using your eyes.\n\nThis is from a blind perspective, but not solely. The vast majority of the cues discussed are sensory input that you already have, and you simply donât realize or pay attention to. \n\nHopefully you'll come away from the talk not just more informed about what walking around actually is like for blind people, but with a noticeable qualitative improvement in how you perceive the world around you.\n\nThis will also (briefly) cover how and how not to interact with a blind person on the street, cognitive shifts from perceiving the world as a blind person, real vs myth difficulties, etc.\n\nThis talk is specifically focused on navigation and sensory experience. It won't cover Braille, computers, general life skills, medical/legal issues, or the like.\n\n\nThe talk will try to cover as much as can be done without direct experience.\n\nHowever, there's a huge qualitative difference between simply hearing me talk about it (or show you), and experiencing it for yourself.  \n\n\nTherefore, I am also running hands-on, 1-hour workshops (2 per day). \n\nWorkshop participants will be blindfolded, given a guide cane, and led through a crash course in how to use and perceive the cues that are discussed in the talk, and an additional Q&A / debriefing session afterwards. This starts from simply walking parallel to a road, and quickly escalates to hearing corridors, feeling walls at a (short) distance, etc.\n\n\nIf you're interested, please fill out the form: https://s.ai/emf/ws",

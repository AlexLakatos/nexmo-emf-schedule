    "description": "At EMF it's easy to see lots of cool things and think you \"that's awesome, but I couldn't possibly do that!\": this talk is about how to overcome that feeling and get started in a new domain.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, despite having not done any woodwork since high school, I decided to turn my hand at building electric guitars; with success enough that people are now commissioning me to make them for them. But to keep such an ambitious project manageable I had to create structure and tools around how I approached getting started and continuing to develop, and find ways to keep myself motivated in the days when it all goes wrong. This talk will review those methods so that you can try and apply them when you go to head off in a new direction yourself.",

Ultimately pushing them to better secure their services and thus protecting your privacy.\r\n\r\nAfter a short introduction you'll be surfing the web, finding names, addresses and urls of the UK government and adding them to the map. They will automatically be scanned for basic security. If all is well, they are shown green, otherwise orange or red. Expect a lot of red.\r\n\r\nThe results of our work will be sent to various press agencies in the UK. We hope they start asking questions about the sad state of security. This causes responsible organizations to wake up and adopt better practices, securing your data and privacy. We've seen this work in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nYou can expect: It's a lot of fun to see the amount of data grow, and more terribleness appear. Club Mate will be provided. The hunt is on!\r\n\r\nRequirements: This workshop is suitable for anyone with basic computer knowledge. Bring your own laptop / tablet / smartphone.\r\n\r\nAll data gathered is published publicly in easy to consume formats. The software running this is fully open source and available on gitlab.

There’ll be a small workshop at the beginning and the end so that we demystify the way computers work and understand what we're all doing.\r\n\r\nThis is a good companion to other programming workshops because it turns the concept on its head, with the participants running, not writing, programs.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just about *being* a CPU though, our aim is to optimise one. After running the first program, your team will be able to make changes to the CPU's arrangement and operation to optimise yourselves. If you've ever asked yourself \"what does it mean to be part of a 5-stage pipeline?\" or thought \"Can I try branch prediction today?\" then this is definitely the workshop for you.

I will also show some images of projects that I have worked with including decellularisation of animal tissue. In this talk I aim to create a vision in the minds of the audience of the endless possibilities that can be done with stem cells, and a possible near future of a pick-n-mix of organ/tissue design.",

As the UK mostly invented a lot of this stuff, it's applicable worldwide :)\r\n\r\nCome and be surprised how not-boring railways actually are (and how you could in theory implement a lot of it with arduinos and raspberry pis)!\r\n\r\nIncludes stories such as 'You could basically still repeat the great train robbery today, here's how' and 'Can you stop trains with only an ISM band radio?'. The speaker highly recommends none of this is applied in the real world. It would definitely not be a good idea. Please don't. But it's nice to know some technical details at least.\r\n\r\nThe speaker will assume no previous knowledge and the content is appropriate for all.

We’re professionalising and expanding our abilities, but in doing so we’re encountering dramatic new risks and venturing into new ethical territory. In this way, we share similarities with the expansion of traditional civil engineering during the industrial revolution. In this talk I’ll discuss what lessons can we learn from that industry, and how we can try to avoid making some of the same mistakes. I’ll also give a basic introduction to engineering ethics, discuss some examples of ethical problems from my own career, and explore how we can try to improve our ethical decision-making by incorporating ethical reasoning into the different stages of our work.",

But now, scientists and industry professionals are looking into how we can adapt spider silk for our own purposes. Want a giant net that can catch falling Jumbos? We're on it. How about a biocompatible silk scaffold to help regrow that broken bone? We're on that too. \r\n\r\nThis is a 30 minute talk on the subject of spider silk aimed at those with an interest in, but no specialist knowledge of, science. There will be some pictures of spiders at the start but should otherwise be friendly for those who are interested but wary of things with eight legs. ",

She rejoices in her discovery, until Other Mother and the rest of her parallel family try to keep her there forever. Coraline must use all her resources and bravery to make it back to her own family and life.\r\n\r\nThis beautifully animated piece takes Neil Gaiman’s source material and spins it into a fun and sometimes creepy fairy tale. Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) creates a series of stop-motion set pieces that equally bewilder and delight. A delicious alternative to saccharine-sweet Hollywood standards.\r\n\r\nMay be unsuitable for younger children.",

The platform also had to be able to extract key facts about the underlying events mentioned in the articles.\r\n\r\nI would like share the story of how our team, that had never met in person, put together a platform using almost 100% open source tools, and ultimately won the competition. We were subsequently invited to Geneva to help implement our platform, and we presented it to the broader non-profit community at an event at the International Red Cross museum.\r\n\r\nDuring my talk the areas I would like to address are:\r\n1. My experience of learning & getting involved in data science/programming/machine learning as a non-professional programmer\r\n2. What it was like to work on something constructive with a team from around the world that had never met each other\r\n3. The motivation behind needing this platform and how we put together a winning solution using open source tools",

Scientists think that Dark Matter is everywhere, streaming through you as you read this right now! Understanding the nature of Dark Matter is one of the most important scientific missions of our time. In this talk, I will present what evidence we have for the existence of Dark Matter, what we know, and how we go about finding out more about it.

No previous knowledge of Lua or game development required :D\r\n\r\n**If you want to get a jump start on things before the workshop, please download Unity, Steam, and have a read of 'Getting Started with Levelkit' on our wiki:. http://wiki.offgridthegame.com/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_the_LevelKit\r\n\r\nYou can watch the 2016 EMF talk here:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=suEXrMO6rQo#\r\n\r\nRead what Eurogamer has to say about Off Grid here:  https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-15-off-grid-is-about-the-principles-of-hacking\r\n",

Throw in some science-fiction utopias and dystopias, loneliness and companionship, law and ethics, privacy and community and there is so much to be learned about our future with machines that could care for us and about us. The speaker has spent the past four years learning all about this topic: from 30,000 year old dildos to the world's first commercially-available sex robot (on sale now).

Sadly, maintaining, repairing and sustaining can be challenging in a fast-moving era, where this work can be seen as boring and low value, compared to the excitement around inventing or making new things. It is easy to forget that apps, data and connected systems need maintenance too, if they are to realise their potential and be useful or fun for more than a brief moment. \r\n\r\nAnd it’s not always easy. It can be hard to find good resourcing models for long-lasting products, or for looking after new forms of shared infrastructure (such as open source software libraries). Strong commons models, where groups share and steward resources (whether the knowledge in Wikipedia or open hardware designs) are scarce or difficult to replicate. \r\n\r\nWe’ll talk about maintenance, good and bad examples of it, and what we are doing to recognise the work done in repair, custodianship, stewardship, tending and caring for things that matter.  \r\n",

    "description": "The drop spindle is a simple, handheld device, used to turn raw fibres into useable yarns and strings. In use since before recorded history, and still in use today, the drop spindle is portable, lightweight and versatile. It can be used to make a variety of yarns, from simple and practical, to bold and creative.\r\n\r\nYou'll learn the basics of how to turn soft, non-scratchy, merino wool fibre into a useable yarn. How to tweak your spinning to make yarns suitable for different purpose, and how to finish your yarns ready for use. We'll also cover the different kinds of plant and animal fibres, and their properties in spinning. There will be an oppourtunity to see a variety of different fibres, but wool will be the only fibre availiable to work with, as it is by far the simplest for beginners.\r\n\r\nThe kit is yours to take home, and includes 100g of wool fibre. Enough to make a full sized ball of yarn.",

Similar control on sound is difficult: you need expensive sets of speakers, like the ones in musical festivals, in ultrasound scanners, and in haptic devices.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will introduce another way: using 3D-printed materials, specially-engineered to manipulate sound. Using tractor beams, levitation pods (for polystyrene beads) and other demos, I will guide the audience towards a (not-so-far) future where what we see in science fiction movies like Iron Man or Minority Report is real. A world where two people will be able to listen at two different programs from the same radio or to receive personalised sound messages without headphones. A world where music at outdoor festivals and in beer gardens will be managed while preserving airflow. A world where sound control is a DIY task.",

As of Aug 2018 Matrix has around 5.5M reachable users and over 8000 server instances, ranging from individual personal servers through to massive deployments for governments and telcos - and a huge community of open source contributors building alternative clients, bots,  bridges, servers etc.\r\n\r\nToday Matrix is in late beta, but as of the end of 2017 the protocol is feature frozen as we converge on a 1.0 release later in 2018.  In this talk we'll give an overview of the Matrix protocol, the ecosystem, the road to 1.0 and show off all the latest clients and capabilities - including some of the more exciting non-IM usages, such as VR communication!",

As a scientist (and failure enthusiast), I am trying to encourage my community to talk more about failure, which is difficult since the path to success is to publish about successes and to hide failures. Let's do more to talk about failure as a Maker community. Let's be honest about the dead-ends and dumb mistakes that got us to that early prototype. Rather than ridiculing 'fails', let's instead celebrate them, since they're what we learn from and allows us to become better than we are.\r\n\r\nInstead of teaching people that failure is bad, let's teach them how to be resilient to failure - give them a safe space to fail in, and provide them the encouragement to keep working towards success. \r\n\r\nAs a social experiment, I will setup a slackline at EMF Camp and invite you to come and try to slackline for the first time and *livestream you failure* with the tag #EMFailure.

    "description": "Tagline: \"I almost wish there were a conspiracy, but I'm afraid it's much worse than that.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a widely, but vaguely, appreciated fact that banks and banking are powerful and important aspects of modern history, which affect almost all aspects of politics and society. Most thoughtful people, reflecting on the present trajectory of history, get the uncomfortable feeling that we are all being driven toward economic, political and ecological disaster, and that international banking has something to do with it.\r\n\r\nThis has made banking the focus of numerous conspiracy theories, most of which contain useful and verifiable information, but all of which fail in one key respect: they all subordinate the banking system to the agency of secretive groups of people who supposedly control the whole system across generations.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy scenario, bad as it is, holds out the comforting thought that if we could just identify and take out the shadowy figures who are really in control, then everything could be put right. But what if the truth is even more terrible? What if the system has its own internal logic, like a virus or an algorithm, which needs no human hand to guide it?\r\n\r\nThis talk goes back to the basic principles, and the medieval Italian and English origins, of the banking system to explore its algorithmic properties. I will argue that credit systems are not only a powerful tool in the hands of human and organizations like governments and corporations, but also that they have revolutionary effects on the priorities and and agendas of those organizations. That the tool, in other words - like Elric of Melnibone's 'Stormbringer' or Faust's 'Mephistopheles' - guides the hand that seek to wield it.",

    "description": "How do people with disabilities use the internet? Accessibility and inclusive design have gained popularity recently, but a lot of web developers are still unaware of what they can do to make their sites and apps work for everyone. Even with a lot of goodwill, practical knowledge is needed: it can be overwhelming to try to use a screen reader, use the internet without a mouse, get notifications with no audio or empathise with reading and cognitive impairments. Things like ARIA and tab order logic can also be intimidating and may lead developers to make experiences worse when they think they are improving it.\r\n \r\nThis workshop will be part-talk, part-practical, to demystify accessibility: why it matters, what are the things to consider, how to test and find issues, and most importantly what you can do to fix them. Participants will have hands-on exercises of using a screen reader on their own devices, navigating using just a keyboard, and identify what's a good and a terrible experience. We will work on hands-on exercises with HTML and JavaScript to fix custom components, understand the logic, and for more experienced developers we will cover ARIA components and building accessible custom elements like accordions and tab panels.",

(The USSR's equivalent of the US Space Shuttle)...  and If I'd have asked that question to Woking District council, then I'm guessing the answer would be a list of regulations that would contravene - but in Latvia, the answer was 'Yes, it is your tower so you can do what you like with it...'\r\n\r\nAnd so I had a challenge to work out what could and should be done with the tower and in very British tradition a list of 101 Hacks for a Water Tower was started, which was very rapidly joined by a sister list of 101 Ways to Kill Yourself on Water Tower.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I share some of the journey of exploration into the wonderful world of Water Towers, Soviet Engineering, the Baltics, and a bit of family history. This takes us from the British Water Tower Appreciation Society to Siberia and the SS, whilst taking part in a documentary, getting involved in an Olympic bid, making music, setting up an amateur radio station, breaking records (and a drone) on the tower on the way and much more.\r\n\r\nThe talk is generally light hearted, with a balance of education and amusement.

What should I use?\r\n-\tSoldering best practices and handy tips i.e. how to apply heat and solder to a joint.\r\n-\tVariations in components and the distinctions between polarised and unpolarised parts.\r\n\r\nDuring the workshop I would like to have attendees assemble one easy kit and one intermediate kit. The easy kit is a classic noisemaker/synth circuit, the mini APC (Atari Punk Console) including a small speaker. \r\nThe intermediate kit, which most beginners can handle after soldering the mini APC is a simple 8 step sequencer.

It is easy to build -- designed for total beginners to learn to solder together.  It provides a very low cost, yet powerful, method for making music/sound/noise, and a fun way to learn Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for generating music/sound/noise. This talk will show beginners how the ArduTouch music synthesizer kit makes use of DSP to create its large diversity of music/sound/noise. Mitch will also explain how the touch keyboard works, as well as the cheap amplifier/speaker built into the board. The ArduTouch Arduino library works on any Arduino board and Mitch will demonstrate how to make use of this library to create your own unique synthesizers -- both by hacking some of the many examples it comes with, and by making use of its high-level functions. This talk will also include a demo of some of the music the ArduTouch can make, as well as some wonderful nasty noise!\r\n\r\nA workshop for soldering together ArduTouch music synthesizer kits will be held before the talk on Sunday at 1pm at the Hardware Hacking Area (Camp: G).",

    "description": "As a member of the team who brought WaveNet into production, I would like to give an insight into the technical challenges and the technology which powers Google's voice, and how this type of algorithms could be used to solve other interesting problems.\r\n\r\nWaveNet is a machine learning algorithm developed at (Google) DeepMind which was the first to obtain human-like quality of voice directly modeling waveforms. You can read more about it here: \r\n\r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/ \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet\r\n\r\nSince the original paper was published, there has been several developments to substantially speed up audio generation (several order of magnitude) in order to put it into production, and it is now powering Google's assistant voice in several languages. See also: \r\n\r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/ \r\nhttps://deepmind.com/blog/high-fidelity-speech-synthesis-wavenet/ \r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435\r\n\r\nNote that the technology is not limited to audio and can pretty much work with any signal, but this is so new that we're just scratching the surface of the potential applications.\r\n\r\nIn my talk I will be talking about the basic tech, what it took to get it into production and the more recent developments. I would also like to give a few suggestions and hints on how to reproduce these results: the latest version (WaveRNN) is rather simple to implement and yet very powerful.",

Women, BME (Black and minority ethnic) people, people with disabilities, older people, and people on low incomes are often under-represented in makerspaces. In the first part of this workshop I’ll share some of the ways that makerspaces are managing to include people from these groups. Then I'd love to hear your stories about any successes and challenges you've experienced with building inclusive and diverse makerspace communities. Even if you don't have any success stories, if your makerspace hasn't been able to spend much time on engagement, or if you're not even involved in makerspaces but are curious about technology engagement issues, you're welcome to come along!\r\n\r\nAfter EMF I’ll turn the information crowdsourced during the workshop into a zine so that other makerspaces can benefit from this advice :)",

However, beginners are often prevented from getting started with modular synths by their costs and apparent complexity. This workshop will be a hands-on introduction to making interesting sounds from modular synthesizers for complete beginners. We will use the open source simulated modular synthesizer \"VCV Rack\" to allow the participants to get the feel of working with a real modular synthesizer on their computer.",

This talk will turn the problem around and examine the extent to which neural networks can emulate human creativity. We'll start by thinking about what it means for an algorithmic system to be creative. Then through examples we'll look at how techniques in machine learning can be used to compose original music and generate art. During the talk, we'll get hands-on in modifying the algorithms and tuning neural network parameters to compose new music and paint new pictures as we go. We'll conclude by discussing future directions in the field of computational creativity, and thinking about whether computers will ever be able to match human levels of performance in this area.",

    "description": "In 1976, in an amusement park in Southern California, the crew of The Six Million Dollar Man were setting up a scene in a fun house.  They moved a waxwork dummy, accidentally broke off its arm, and discovered that rather than being made of wax, it was made of a real dead guy.\r\n\r\nWith a bit of investigation, the coroner discovered it was Elmer McCurdy, a failed bank robber who died in 1911.  Between his death and his discovery, he visited sideshows, hung out at Niagra Falls, rode on rollerskates, became a drug addict, and inspired the look of Skeletor from the He-Man cartoons and toys.\r\n\r\nWe'll get into Elmer's actual life, his adventures after his death, and where he's residing now.

    "description": "A Forest School inspired activity. This would appeal to all ages of children as the wands can be as simple or complex as each individual sees fit.  Initially I would set the scene with some tree folklore or story relating to willow and dogwood.  Then, I would show how to bend the willow or dogwood into a wand shape and secure it.  The youngest children could then decorate their wand with natural resources, (or I could provide some coloured string, ribbon, feathers etc).  The older children could use basic woodcrafting tools such as potato peelers to strip the wands and whiltting knives to add carving notches for decoration, in addition.   I would imagine the younger children finishing earlier, but for older children this taking about an hour.  I would prefer all children to be accompanied by an adult, especially if they are hoping to use the tools.  I am a teacher, so CRB checked and Level 3 Qualified Forest School Leader.",

Its pixel art minimalistic visual style makes it perfect to just sit down and make a game in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThe output is a simple HTML file, so the game is not only playable almost everywhere, it’s also really easy to distribute and opens chances of hacking and tinkering.\r\n\r\nWe will learn how to create games with Bitsy, both from a technical point of view and from a narrative point of view. We will explore space layout, dialogues, rhythm.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the workshop you’ll be able to create small narrative experience to enjoy with your friends, to deliver powerful messages and to dip your toe in the crazy world of game making. So, come on over with your laptop. It’s going to be great fun!",

Exercises include drawing cylinders from several angles while being aware of the 3d shape of the object, using a custom grid to copy a sketch and doing several iterations of thumbnails to explore an idea for a drawing. All the while, feedback and suggestions are offered to the participants.\r\n\r\nThe end outcome is that participants gain more confidence in their drawing abilities, go deeper into drawing even simple forms and understand that the underlying process for drawing is not a magical fuzzy path, but consists of many sequential and ‘deterministic’ steps.",

You learn that this magic box can be programmed to do all sorts of amazing things, but are never really given the details as to how it does it. I wanted to know more, and after some research I started making logic gates with the one bit of electronics I knew how to use: Electric relays. I scrounged parts from cars, microwaves, scrap change machines, etc and put them together into increasingly complex contraptions. Two years later, I had TIM 8: a fully programmable 8 bit relay computer. This is the story of how TIM 8 came about, what I learnt along the way, and how relay computers are a fantastic way to demonstrate how a computer really works.\r\n\r\nFor the talk I would bring a presentation and TIM 8 (the size of a small suitcase).",

    "description": "Information security is a big deal nowadays as more and more people start to take their privacy online very seriously. But what's the point of protecting yourself if the web services you use are vulnerable to big scary hackers?\r\n\r\nIf you want to catch a glimpse of penetration testing, come along and learn about concepts such as discovering vulnerabilities, running through them, exploiting and patching them.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be based around a University coursework project, where an older version of web forum software \"phpBB\" is examined, exploited and patched. The technologies that phpBB was built on were quite simple, so the main focus of the talk will be the process of penetration testing.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics covered will include sanitising user input, as well as enforcing file and variable scopes. You will familiarise yourself with concepts such as never trusting user input and get to see exploits such as cross-site scripting and remote code execution.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will wrap up by patching out these vulnerabilities and hopefully learn a thing or two about building more secure software.",

Soon, armed with delusions of grandeur, things inevitably spiralled about of control and now my garage door has an API.\r\n\r\nThis talk is equal parts tutorial, inspiration and lunacy as I take the audience through my projects and hopefully dispel some of the mystery of IoT devices, showing how it can be easy to learn and a lot of fun to build.\r\n\r\nHighlights include a Scottish toilet emergency, an aquarium featuring military-grade security and an extinction-level event in the suburbs of Milton Keynes.\r\n",

    "description": "There are a number of emoji that, when used in digital communications, don't always refer to their original meaning. The peach emoji, for example, has been found through research conducted by emojipedia to refer most often not to the fruit, but to buttocks. Other fruit and vegetables emoji have suffered a similar fate.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explore the ways that emoji are frequently misunderstood or misused - referring to some of the leading research conducted by academics in the area. I will conclude with peer reviewed research that I have conducted looking at the ways we assign new meaning to emoji when communicating with a single other person. Why do we do this and how do we choose the emoji we use. Why is it that despite there being a heart emoji available, some of us choose to use 🍕 to say \"I love you\"?\r\n\r\nThe set is presented in a stand up comedy-style and despite discussing academic research is very accessible to any range of audience. Although parental guidance may be advised.",

We will then move on to some chains using the basics of these weaves (Box chain, Byzantine Chain, Helm Chain).\r\n\r\nIf there is time and/or interest after this, I'd welcome some time looking at specific projects and helping to start those projects off.

But podcasting has not only survived three global hype cycles it's also one of the most resilient and unique media forms on the Internet. So far, Podcasting has successfully resisted being sucked up by a single YouTube-style platform that looks helpful in the beginning but would set the rules of its community in the future.\r\n\r\nInstead Podcasting is very much alive and has proven to be able to create new and serve to existing communities, communicate effectively to its audience and establish a following other media types haven't seen yet. Podcasts are sexy and you really want to know why.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explain in detail why podcasts matter, what makes podcasts magical when combined with community, why almost everybody should consider starting a podcast, which infrastructure on the net is actually useful, what kind of hardware is actually needed and what open source and free-ish tools exist to publish high quality audio content on the web today.",

From alkaline hydrolysis to freeze-drying, there are many (legal) ways to dispose of a body. Whether you want to nourish fungi, roses, a coral reef or the minds of trainee doctors, your remains could make the world a better place. Why be scattered, when you can leave behind something way more interesting?\r\n\r\nThis session will look at what actually happens in a crematorium and a burial (both traditional and green) as well as some of the more unusual alternatives that are now available to dispose of a body and the controversies that surround them.\r\n\r\nPlease note: if you just can’t live with your spouse any more, or you have a life-long vendetta against someone, this session won’t help you get that sorted out. Seek counselling. Buy a pet. Get out more. But don’t kill them.\r\n",

I want to do the same with jewelry-making.\r\n\r\nI'll have some prototypes and demos, and I'd like to talk about how to use them, how they help me visualize the flow of electricity, and how to contribute.

The science section will cover topics from the anatomy to health, menstruation to menopause, contraception to consent, sexuality to gender identity. The culture collection will showcase the anatomy in the arts and their contribution to the discourse about our genitals, for example The Great Wall of Vagina or The Handmaid’s Tale. The society gallery will explore genitals’ place in society, e.g. religious rites surrounding menstruation, the practises of FGM, of which over 200 million people are living today suffering from, sexual violence and how these cases are dealt with in court. The history gallery will contain objects relating to the history of gynaecological medicine, contraception, menstrual products and sex work.",

    "description": "You’ve heard of smart phones, smart meters, smart watches… even smart fridges. Well now it’s the turn of smart materials.\r\n\r\nThis is a show about the future of stuff. Within our lifetimes, solid objects will react, sense, change and move according to their surroundings. This won’t be a result of fancy robotics or cunning electronics, but rather the fundamental properties of the materials themselves. Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci’s flying machine, drawn over 500 year ago, smart materials will make our aeroplanes of the future adapting, sensing and morphing, so that they fly like birds or bats. In years to come, we will be living in self-regulating houses, riding self-fixing bicycles, and driving on self-illuminating roads, all thanks to smart materials. These are metals, plastics, fabrics and fluids that react to the outside world without any human involvement, and they promise to change the way we live our lives forever.\r\n\r\nIn this one hour show, an award-winning materials scientist and engineer will be your guide on the smart material safari. There will be demonstrations of the smart materials that exist today, and exploration on how they will make the material world around us smarter tomorrow. Expect to see matter doing things you’ve never seen it do before!\r\n",

    "description": "HiTag2 is an RFID technology operating at 125KHz. It is distinguished from many others in the same field by its use of 2-way communications for authentication and its use of encryption to protect the data transmissions - the majority of RFID technologies at 125KHz feature no authentication or encryption at all. As a result it has been widely used to provide secure building access and has also been used as the technology that implements car immobilisers.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, academic researchers Roel Verdult, Flavio D. Garcia and Josep Balasch published the seminal paper, ‘Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2’ that presented three attacks on the encryption system used in HiTag2. They implemented their attacks on the Proxmark 3 device (an RFID research and hacking tool) and gave several high-profile demonstrations, but didn’t release any of their code or tools. Since then, the forums supporting Proxmark 3 and RFIDler (another RFID hacking tool) have received many requests for implementations of these attacks, but until recently none had been forthcoming. Garcia et al went on to produce a fast correlation attack in the 2016 paper, ‘Lock It and Still Lose It’.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explain how HiTag2 RFID works in detail, including the PRNG and the authentication and encryption protocols, and will present my own implementations of the attacks, written for RFIDler and supported by desktop computers. The first attack uses a nonce replay to misuse the integrity protection of the comms in order to allow access to the readable RFID tag pages without needing to know the key. The second, third and fourth attacks use time/memory trade-off brute force, cryptanalytic attacks and a fast correlation attack to recover the key, such that the contents of the read-protected pages can also be accessed. The attacks are weaponised and permit cloning of tags, which I will demonstrate.",

Starting simply, with creating your own contact mics and spring reverbs, progressing all the way to creating your own midi controllers and fully programmable digital audio effects. The concept is to show you how easy it is to get started (I had no formal electronics background, and just learnt from experimenting) and inspire you to get started making NOISE.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover my personal journey through DIY instrument building, which I embarked on initially to build a simple item I needed for my live performance, and rapidly spiralled out of control!\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/sdTysy3dD84\r\nhttps://youtu.be/gib-URplJxI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xWpq3soblYY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/5j84GfI8yQM\r\n\r\nAbout the artist:\r\nCutlasses is the solo project of musician and DIY electronic instrument maker, Scott Pitkethly.  \r\n\r\nHe has given a number of of talks on the subject of DIY instrument building, as well as talks on other programming related subjects.  His electronic instruments won the Music Hackspace DIY Instrument award, and have featured on sites such as Hackaday and Create Digital Music.

What will the future hold for the human body and communication when we boldly go into space? What ethical consideration must we take to ensure that it is the many who control their personal data?\r\n\r\nWe’ve been making educational, technologically exciting ballets and performance workshops for five years now. As artists we want to do collaborative learning with our audiences, to help them express their own ideas within a collaborative artistic technological framework. It is not just a performance to sit down and watch. Art and performance can break down the traditional barriers to audiences that consider themselves non-technical. We like to release as much of our performance and learning materials as possible as open source.\r\n\r\nOur project is long-running, and has tackled subjects from chronic pain to sorting algorithms. Now we are looking to space, brain hacking, and unashamed futurism. How can we begin to live in the future while increasing accessibility and inclusivity? What are the ethical concerns surrounding things that might seem abstract at first glance - like brainwave data?\r\n\r\nClassical ballet might sound like a strange way to learn about technology, ethics and medicine, but we hope to change the way you think about education/learning. Combining the algorithmic nature of classical ballet with futuristic thinking, breaking down artificial cultural barriers and fostering personal creative ownership for all. \r\n\r\nMay contain duct tape.",

    "description": "CANUTE, is a multi-line refreshable Braille display. The project has been developed using Bristol Hackspace as a base and workshop facility by Bristol Braille Technology which is a Not For Profit enterprise. We are working on open sourcing elements of the project because having an open source data protocol will expand the avenues for information and equipment it can link into and the information it can display. Currently available displays are one line of text and between 20 and 80 letters long, Canute will be both 9 lines and affordable.\r\n\r\nThe blind community are currently poorly supported with literature as very little is transferred to bulky Braille paper format and this has an impact on literacy and employment and access to modern communication. So much information is displayed 'on the screen' and Text-To-Speech is not always convenient (and is often inconvenient) and is a very different experience to reading. We aim to reverse this with CANUTE which will be the world's first electronic multi-line refreshable Braille display.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly 6 years of development on gifted and sponsored budgets in the corner of a Hackspace using Chinese motors, modules the prototype model has attracted the attention of brailleists and support organisations all over the world. we have spent the last 12 months converting the design from prototype 3D printed parts to use all mass produced parts and injection moulded components which is a process fraught with technical difficulties and problems.\r\n\r\nThere will be machine(s) available to demonstrate during and after the presentation. \r\nhttp://www.bristolbraille.co.uk/ ",

We will be focusing on the future of 3D Printing, but the process I will guide you through can be applied to anything and everything. This will provide a great opportunity to flex your creative muscles and question how we want to use technology in the future. We will be using a combination of sketching, drawing, sketch modelling, illustrating, doodling…pretty much anything you want to create your 3D Printers of the future.  \r\n\r\nSome materials will be provided for you to rip, tear, cut, stick and glue, but do bring along any materials you think could be useful.",
